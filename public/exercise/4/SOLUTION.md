# Solution: Collect All Beepers

## Solution Explanation
This exercise teaches conditional logic and safe movement by requiring Karel to collect scattered beepers while avoiding runtime errors.
We introduce a "missionComplete" flag to track when Karel has finished collecting all beepers. The code uses a loop to continue moving and checking for beepers until Karel reaches the end of the street.
Here's how the solution works:
```c
void studentCode() {
    static bool missionComplete = false;
    static int totalCollected = 0;
    
    while (!missionComplete) {
        // Collect beeper if present
        if (beepers_present()) {
            karel_pick_beeper();
            totalCollected++;
            printf("Beeper #%d collected!\n", totalCollected);
        }
        
        // Continue or finish
        if (front_is_clear()) {
            karel_move();
        } else {
            missionComplete = true;
            printf("Street cleared! %d beepers collected total.\n", totalCollected);
        }
    }
}


```

### 1. **Conditional Beeper Detection**
To check the presence of a beeper in the current position, we use the `beepers_present()` function. This prevents Karel from trying to pick up a beeper when there isn't one, avoiding runtime errors.

```c
if (beepers_present()) {
    karel_pick_beeper();  // Only pick when beeper exists
}
```
If there is a beeper, Karel picks it up and increments the `totalCollected` counter to keep track of how many beepers have been collected.


### 2. **Safe Movement Control**
In the while loop, we check if Karel can move forward using `front_is_clear()`. If the path is clear, Karel moves forward; otherwise, it stops and sets `missionComplete` to true.
```c
if (front_is_clear()) {
    karel_move();  // Only move when path is clear
} else {
    // Handle wall/obstacle
    missionComplete = true;  // Stop when hitting a wall
    printf("Reached the end of the street!\n");
}
```


### 4. **Error Prevention**
- Always check `beepers_present()` before `karel_pick_beeper()`
- Always check `front_is_clear()` before `karel_move()`
- Use static variables to prevent repeated actions

## Debugging Tips
1. **Print Karel's position** to track movement progress
2. **Count beepers collected** to verify completeness
3. **Add status messages** to understand current action
4. **Test with different beeper patterns** to ensure robustness

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Calling `karel_pick_beeper()` without checking `beepers_present()`
- Calling `karel_move()` without checking `front_is_clear()`
- Not handling the end-of-street condition properly
- Forgetting to use static variables for state persistence

## Extensions
- Collect beepers in both directions (forward and backward)
- Count and report different types of items
- Navigate more complex street layouts with turns
- Add time-based performance metrics
