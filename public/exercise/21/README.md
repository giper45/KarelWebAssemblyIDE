# Karel Control Structures

## Objective
Master C control structures (if-else, loops, switch) by programming Karel's intelligent behavior and decision-making.

## Background
Control structures determine the flow of program execution. With Karel, you'll implement:
- **Conditional Logic**: Make Karel respond to different world conditions
- **Loops**: Create efficient repetitive behaviors
- **Switch Statements**: Handle multiple action choices
- **Nested Structures**: Combine conditions and loops for complex behaviors

## Your Task
1. Use if-else statements for Karel's decision making
2. Implement while and for loops for repetitive actions
3. Create switch statements for behavior selection
4. Combine control structures for complex navigation patterns
5. Practice nested loops and conditional logic

## Key Concepts
- **if-else**: `if(front_is_clear()) karel_move(); else karel_turn_left();`
- **while loops**: `while(beepers_present()) karel_pick_beeper();`
- **for loops**: `for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) karel_move();`
- **switch statements**: Choose actions based on direction or state
- **Nested structures**: Loops inside conditions, conditions inside loops
- **Break and continue**: Control loop execution flow

## Control Structure Applications
- Adaptive navigation based on world conditions
- Beeper collection with intelligent searching
- Pattern recognition and response
- State-based behavior switching

## Karel Functions in Control Contexts
- `front_is_clear()`, `beepers_present()` - Condition testing
- `facing_east()`, `facing_north()` - Direction-based decisions
- `karel_move()`, `karel_turn_left()` - Actions within loops
- `karel_pick_beeper()`, `karel_put_beeper()` - Conditional actions

## Tips
- Use meaningful condition names for clarity
- Avoid infinite loops by ensuring terminating conditions
- Consider all possible cases in switch statements
- Use break statements appropriately in switches
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
