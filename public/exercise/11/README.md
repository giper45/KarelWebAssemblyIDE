# Check Every Box

Learn to use for loops to iterate through a sequence of boxes, checking each one and performing actions based on conditions.


Learn to use for loops to repeat sequences of movements efficiently and create predictable patterns.

## Problem Description
Karel is standing on a horizontal row with some squares containing beepers. He must move over each square and, if there is a beeper, remove it. Use a while loop with front_is_clear() and an if beepers_present() condition. 

Repeat the exercise using a for loop to iterate through the squares.


## Initial Setup
- Karel starts at position (1,1) facing East
- The row contains squares with beepers at positions (2,1), (4,1), and (6,1)
- Karel must check each square and remove any beepers found
